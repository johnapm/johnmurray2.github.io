<h1>Welcome to Streamplate.</h1>

<p>
Hey,<br> 
I hope you guys are doing well, and the cafe is running smoothly. <br>
I'm part of a team that's developing a personalised food-ordering app called Streamplate, and I'd like to invite you to check it out; we're specifically targeting venues in the Chippendale area like Cafe Giulia.<br> 
Streamplate provides pre-ordering, at-table ordering, reservations, nutrition/allergen filtering and messaging; for venues, there’s a free point of sales system, timesheet management and clock in/out functionality.<br>
We’re more personalised than Hey You; our users get a personalised experience that still lets them connect with you. <br>
We’ll upload your menu & create your profile. If you have any questions issues, we have 24/7 customer service. <br>
The full list of features is avalable <a href="https://streamplate.com">here.</a> <br>
I'd love to have a conversation about how we can get you up and running with us; please feel free to contact me at any time either by phone or email.
<br>
Thanks!
<p>
